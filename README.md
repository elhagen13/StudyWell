# StudyWell

StudyWell is a website designed to help people work for longer periods by implementing the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is comprised of focused work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks that a user alternates between while working on a to-do list. Some features that our website has is a To-Do list, a tracker of how many Pomodoro sessions one has had, a short break feature, and a long break page. Users may check off items on their to-do list and delete them entirely. The site features a minimalistic design so as to minimize distraction and purely have the user focus on the task at hand.
